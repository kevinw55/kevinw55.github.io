      <p>Anyone who used a computer in the 1960s or early 1970s, (except those made by IBM), would almost certainly have used an ASR-33 Teletype as the main input/output device.</p>

<p>ASR stood for Automatic Send Receive. They were made by the Teletype corporation, of Illinois, and were almost completely mechanical – which meant that they required regular maintenance and oiling.  If you were in a room which had a lot of them, all in use, it was a bit like being an a garage – very noisy and a smell of warm oil in the air.</p>

<p>It was quite difficult to type quickly, because after using one for a while, your fingers would start to ache – you had to depress the keys for a full centimeter, with a reasonable amount of force, and there was a solid clunk which told you that the character had been entered.</p>

<p>The paper was fed off a roll, and the print head used an ink ribbon, like a typewriter.  It used upper case characters only – it was one of the first devices to use the newly invented 7-bit ASCII codes – and could print at about 10 characters/second.  Some of the ASCII control codes (or rather their interpretation) were influenced by the design of the ASR-33.  The ASCII code 07 was known as BEL because it caused a teletype to ring a small bell, which was built into the casing.  IBM machines had their own, different character set called EBCDIC.</p>

<p>The print quality wasn’t particularly good, by modern standards.</p>

<p>There was a paper tape punch and reader on the left hand side of the unit. The Teletype could be used in local mode, by using the small knob on the lower right corner of the front panel. This would disconnect it from the remote computer and allowed you to punch your program onto paper type, without wasting valuable computer time. You could then go online, and have the tape reader read in the program from the tape and input to the computer – it’s transmission speed was 110 baud (bits/second).</p>

<p>Once you went online, the printer and the tape punch were under the control of the computer, so you could also punch a copy of whatever data or program was coming from the computer. Punched tape was how you kept a backup copy of your programs. Floppy disks were far too expensive, and USB sticks wouldn’t exist for another 20 years or so.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the 1970s, simple video terminals were becoming more widespread, Teletypes were still being used as printers, or for data preparation – whilst studying in the early 1980s, for a BSc in Computer Science, we were only allowed 6 hours a week on a video terminal, but there was also a room full of Teletypes which you could use on a drop-in basis. So you didn’t waste valuable connect time typing in a long program on a video terminal when you could punch it onto tape off-line, and then feed it in via the tape reader.</p>
