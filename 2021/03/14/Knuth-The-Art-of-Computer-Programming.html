<p>One book that usually crops up on most people’s lists of ‘Classic Computer Science Texts’ is Professor Donald Knuth’s multi-volume ‘The Art of Computer Programming’.</p>

<p>It was one of the references that I was given on my degree course in 1980, and it is still referred to today, possibly because, as of 2021, he is still writing it.</p>

<p>It was originally planned in 1962 as one book, with 12 chapters.  It soon became apparent that each pair of chapters were going to need their own book, and so seven volumes were planned, with the first ones being published as follows:</p>

<pre>
Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms        First published 1968  
Volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms      First published 1969  
Volume 3: Sorting and Searching         First published 1973  
</pre>

<p>Since then, the field of Computer Science has, to put it mildly, changed beyond all recognition.  So Knuth spent the next 30 years revising those volumes, some more than once.  As well as this, he spent about ten years developing the computerised typesetting system called TeX, which forms the basis of Latex, which is used by academics all over the world, because he was so dissatisfied with the appearance of the mathematical equations in the galley proofs of the second editions.</p>

<p><img class="centre imageshadow" src="/assets/images/20210314/knuth 001.jpg" alt="Knuth sample 1" /></p>

<p>After retiring from his Academic duties, he decided to devote himself full time to completing the rest of  what now he views as his life’s work.  About ten years ago, after a gap of 38 years, he published the next volume:</p>

<pre>
Volume 4a: Combinatorial Algorithms, Part 1    First published 2011
</pre>

<p>He now publishes draft copies of future chapters on his website and also as paperback fascicles, and invites comments and criticisms.  Famously he used to send a cheque for $2.56 to anyone who found an error in any of  his draft chapters, but due to the increased possibility of bank fraud, and also due to the fact that very few people actually cashed them, preferring instead to keep the cheque itself, he now sends them a small certificate instead.</p>

<p>All scientific subjects, at the higher levels, consist of representing the thing being studied by mathematical equations.  In The Art of Computer Programming, it is the behaviour and performance of algorithms that are the subject of study.</p>

<p>The algorithms are presented in a virtual machine language of his own devising, called MIX, however, in the third edition of Vol 1, he admits that the MIX architecture is now completely obselete, and promises that in future editions, a new language called MMIX, based on a RISC architecture, will be used.  To illustrate just how outdated the MIX language is, he points out in a footnote that it was invented before the meaning of the term ‘byte’ had become standardised to 8 bits, and in the MIX language, a byte holds 6 bits.</p>

<p><img class="centre imageshadow" src="/assets/images/20210314/knuth 003.jpg" alt="Knuth sample 3" /></p>

<p>On his website, he advises people who wish to contact him not to use email, as he no longer has an email address.  Instead, they should write him a letter to the address that he provides.  There is an email address for people who wish to report errors in his books, which his secretary checks.  Anything other than error reports are not passed on to him.</p>

<p>Professor Knuth is a very wise man.</p>
