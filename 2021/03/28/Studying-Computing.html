<p>The University of Essex had one main computer in the late 1970s - a similar system is shown in the picture below.</p>

<p>It was kept in an air-conditioned, dust-free room.</p>

<p>The hardware was so valuable that only systems operators had access to it.  Students were not allowed in.</p>

<p>The disk drives were also kept in the systems room - there are two at bottom left in the picture.  Each unit would have had a capacity of between 50 and 100 MB.</p>

<p>There was a large line printer - bottom right in the picture - which was located next to the computer lab so that the students could collect their print-outs.</p>

<p>"The Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 (1964-1983) is one of the most influential computers in history.</p>
<p>It was the foundation of the DECsystem-10 and the DECSYSTEM-20, and ran a variety of operating systems including TOPS-10, ITS, WAITS, TYMCOM-X, TENEX, and TOPS-20.</p> 
<p>It was the first widely used timesharing system.</p> 
<p>It was the basis of the ARPANET (now Internet).</p> 
<p>TOPS-10 (Timesharing OPerating System-10) preceded TOPS-20 by many years (TOPS-10 circa 1964; TOPS-20 circa 1976). </p>
<p>Its command language is familiar to anybody who has used RT-11, CP/M, or DOS, all of which were based on it. </p>
<p>TOPS-10 supported interactive timesharing, batch processing, and realtime applications simultaneously — a difficult mix to accommodate, even today."</p>

<p>From:
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/pdp10.html">The Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10</a></p>

<p>The PDP-10 was available in several configurations, including the original KA10, the KI10, and the KS10.</p>

<p><img class="centre-wide imageshadow" src="/assets/images/20210328/Table1.png" alt="Table" /></p>

<h2 id="the-operators-console">The Operator’s Console</h2>

<p>The system operator was responsible for the smooth running of the hardware and software, and dealing with problems as they arose.  They also had to deal with sarcastic messages sent by the students in the interactive computer lab when the system was down.</p>

<p><img class="centre imageshadow clear" src="/assets/images/20210328/Console1.png" alt="Console" /></p>

<h2 id="the-interactive-computer-lab">The Interactive Computer Lab</h2>

<p><img class="centre imageshadow" src="/assets/images/20210328/ComputerLab.png" alt="Computer Lab" /></p>

<p>This was one way that undergraduate students could use the computer.  We were allowed six hours connect time per week, and they had to be booked in advance, on a time sheet which was posted up on the wall of the lab.</p>

<h2 id="open-access-computer-lab">Open Access Computer Lab</h2>

<p>The other lab contained the older hardware, such as teletypes and card punches, as well the data entry office.  These could be used at any time without the need to book, on a first-come first-served basis.</p>

<p><img class="centre imageshadow" src="/assets/images/20210328/CardPunch.png" alt="Computer Lab" /></p>

<p>The card punches could be used to punch your program on to a deck of cards, which would then be given in to the data entry office, for input into the computer overnight.</p>

<p><img class="centre imageshadow" src="/assets/images/20210328/Teletype.png" alt="Computer Lab" /></p>

<p>The teletypes could also be used in off-line mode to punch a program onto paper tape, and then switched into on-line mode to feed the program into the computer.  Given the typing speed of the average student, it would not make sense to waste connect time on something like data entry.</p>

<p><img class="centre imageshadow" src="/assets/images/20210328/Coding Sheet 001.jpg" alt="Computer Lab" /></p>

<p>Another alternative was to fill in coding sheets, (with your best handwriting, of course), and give them in to the data entry office, where clerks would type them in for you, and return them the next day, along with a card deck or roll of punched tape if requested.</p>

<p><img class="centre imageshadow" src="/assets/images/20210328/Coding Sheet 003.jpg" alt="Computer Lab" /></p>

<p>In 1980 the University opened a second lab, this time equipped with about 20 early microcomputer systems.  Each student was issued with two 5.25 inch floppy disks, one of which contained the operating system and applications software, and one of which was used to store the students work.  The lab was used for teaching some first year units, although second and third year work was done on the mainframe.</p>
