<p>BCPL is a programming language that was popular in the 1970s and 1980s.  It was designed by Mark Richards in 1967 as a systems programming tool, with an easily portable compiler, and was widely used on many undergraduate courses to teach programming.</p>

<p>BCPL stands for Basic CPL, and as the name implies, it was heavily influenced by CPL, (Combined Programming Language) which was developed at Cambridge and London universities, in 1963.</p>

<p>It’s most distinctive feature, when compared to most high level programming languages, is that it only has one data type - the bit pattern.  This means that there is no need for the programmer to make type declarations - any variable can contain any type of value. Or a better way to put it, is that the value in a variable can be interpreted by the programmer in any way they want.</p>

<p>Having said that, the standard arithmetic and operators are provided - for example, the addition operator (+) interprets the bit patterns as integers, and produces a bit pattern that can also be interpreted as an integer.  But the compiler does no type checking.  That means that it is possible to write a program which will, for example, multiply an integer with a Boolean value and interpret the result as an ASCII code.  This gives the programmer a lot more freedom and flexibility, but it also means that they have to be more careful.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// First BCPL program

GET "LIBHDR"
LET START() BE
    $(
        LET a, b, c, sum = 1, 2, 3, 0
        sum := a + b + c
        WRITES("Sum is ")
        WRITEN(sum)
    $)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The library LIBHDR contains the implementations of the system-dependent commands, which is to the say, the input/output commands.  These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RDCH                (Read Character)</li>
  <li>WRCH                (Write Character)</li>
</ul>

<p>These two form the basis for the other commands, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>WRITES             (Write string)</li>
  <li>WRITEN             (Write integer)</li>
  <li>WRITEOCT</li>
  <li>
    <p>WRITEHEX</p>
  </li>
  <li>READN              (Read integer)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also commands for redirecting streams, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SELECTINPUT(stream)</li>
  <li>SELECTOUTPUT(stream)</li>
</ul>

<p>A BCPL stream is simply regarded as a sequence of characters, with no structure as far as the compiler is concerned.  All I/O operations are simply carried out on the currently selected input or output stream.  It is left to the operating system to connect those streams to physical input and output devices.</p>

<p>BCPL also has the normal control structures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>IF statement</li>
  <li>WHILE loop</li>
  <li>UNTIL loop</li>
  <li>REPEATWHILE loop</li>
  <li>REPEATUNTIL loop</li>
  <li>FOR loop</li>
</ul>

<p>and allows user-defined procedures and functions.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// This program asks the user for a sequence of numbers
// and calculates the factorial of each one
    
GET "LIBHDR"

LET FACTORIAL(num) = VALOF
    $(
        LET total = 1
        FOR x = 1 TO num DO 
            total := total * x
        RESULTIS total
    $)


LET START() BE
    $(
        LET inp = 0
        LET res = 0
        $(
            WRITES("Enter a number - type -1 to finish")
            WRITES("*N")                        // Output a new line
            inp := READN()
            IF inp &gt;= 0 THEN 
                $(
                    res := FACTORIAL(inp)
                    WRITEN(res)
                    WRITES("*N")
                $)
        $) REPEATUNTIL inp &lt; 0
    $)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The only data structure the language provides is a one-dimensional array called a vector, which is accessed by using the ! operator.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// This program reads in 10 numbers into an array and prints them out in reverse order
            
GET "LIBHDR"
LET START() BE
    $(
        LET list = VEC 9    // Creates an array of 10 storage locations

        WRITES("Type in 10 integers*N")
        FOR count = 0 TO 9 DO
            $(
                WRITES("Type in integer ")
                WRITEN(count+1)
                WRITES(" followed by return*N")
                list!count := READN()
            $)
                
        WRITES("They will now be displayed in reverse order*N")
            
        FOR outcount = 9 TO 0 BY -1 DO
            $(
                WRITEN(list!outcount)
                WRITES("*N")
            $)
    $) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want something more complex, like a 2 dimensional array, you have to develop a set of routines and functions to implement that structure.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate that, BCPL provides the operators @ and ! which will interpret a bit pattern as a storage address - in other words, as a pointer.  This allows indirection to be used, and enables the programmer to build more complex data structures.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET "LIBHDR"
LET START() BE
    $(
        LET v = 42
        LET w = 66
        LET a = 0
    
        WRITEN(v)           // Outputs the value '42'
        WRITES("*N")
        WRITEN(@v)          // Outputs the address of the location that contains '42'
        WRITES("*N")

        a := @w             // Stores the address that contains '66' in the variable a
        WRITEN(a)           // Outputs the address that has '66' stored in it
        WRITES("*N") 
        WRITEN(!a)          // Outputs the value that is pointed to by the variable a
        WRITES("*N")
    $)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>BCPL is no longer in widespread use, but it was very influential, due to it being used as the basis of a language called B, that Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson developed at Bell labs in 1969.</p>

<p>When Ritchie was looking for a language in which to develop utility programs, for a new operating system called UNIX that he was implementing, he modified B to add the features that he needed, and named the new language C.</p>

<p>C is still one of the most popular programming languages in use today, especially for jobs like writing compilers and operating system applications.</p>
