<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, the only place where a person might come into contact with a computer was either a large corporation, or a University.</p>

<p>Universities tended to have a slightly more relaxed approach to computer access, and the computer installation would normally attract a community of unofficial users, who would beg, borrow or even steal time on the mainframe computer.  They were tolerated as long as they did not interfere with the normal functioning of the computer lab, sometimes making themselves useful by acting as unpaid computer operators, and helping out other students, in exchange for being able to use the computer at times when it was not busy - often in the evenings or during the night.</p>

<p>The Artificial Intelligence lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was one such community, along with other groups at MIT, such as the Tech Model Railway Club.  This was a student society whose members developed a model railway layout which was so complex, they had to build an automated signalling and routing system.  It was at the TMRC that the term hacker first arose, used in it’s original sense of ‘a person who finds a clever and elegant solution to a problem’.</p>

<p>A similar culture grew up in other university computer labs, such as the Stanford University AI Lab, and  Carnegie-Mellon University, many of which were based around the DEC PDP-10 mainframe computer, one of the first to make timesharing widely available.  Up to then, most computers only operated in batch mode - that is to say, users submitted jobs as a deck of punched cards, or punched tape, and they were processed overnight, with the results returned the next day.  Timesharing allowed a large number of users to communicate with the computer simultaneously, in real time.</p>

<p>Like any community of enthusiasts, over time these computer users developed their own private jargon, a collection of slang terms, in-jokes and made-up words which described the early hacker culture.</p>

<p>This private language was eventually written down and stored in a computer document called the Jargon file, which was circulated via FTP across the ARPANET, and added to by the groups at other universites.  The ARPANET was a project set up in 1969 by the US government, to investigate if it was possible to connect computers up using a packet-switched network across large distances.  This allowed the hacker communities to communicate more easily, especially as, in many cases, they were also the people who were working on the ARPANET project.</p>

<p>The original culture which gave rise to the Jargon File has long since disappeared - DEC systems stopped producing the PDP-10 in 1983, and DEC themselves ceased to exist in 1998.  The computer science labs which allowed unofficial use of their highly valuable resource, computer time, no longer operate in the same way because, to all intents and purposes, computer time is now almost universally available to anyone who wants it.</p>

<p>Even by the late 1970s, hackers were equally likely to be found using the (relatively) much cheaper mini-computers, and experimenting with UNIX or learning to program in C.  This gave rise to another flowering of hacker culture, which led eventually to the creation of Linux, and the rise of the open source movement.</p>

<p>The contents of the old Jargon file were updated to incorporate the UNIX and C culture of the late 1970s and 1980s, and published in 1991 as ‘The New Hacker’s Dictionary’.</p>

<p>That updated version can now be viewed as a historic artefact in it’s own right.  It was published just as the internet was starting to become available to home users.  During the 1990s, the term ‘hacker’ entered popular culture, although, much to the annoyance of the original hackers, it was used to refer to people who illegally broke into other people’s systems, usually for some nefarious purpose.</p>
