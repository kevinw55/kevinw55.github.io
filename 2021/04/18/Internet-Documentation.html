      <p>Request For Comments, or RFCs, are a set of text files, written by engineers and programmers, which document the design of the Internet, and it’s forerunner, the ARPANET, from it’s earliest days.</p>

<p>It started as an informal arrangement amongst the original group of engineers - most of whom were postgraduate students - that had been chosen to attend the meetings of the Network Working Group.  Although another company was responsible for developing and installing the node computers which would link the four original sites, it was left to the people from those sites to decide how to link their computers to the node computers, and how they should communicate across the network.</p>

<p>The students were fairly sure that the people who were in charge - the real experts - would turn up fairly soon and take over, but after a month of meetings there was still no sign of them, so the students decided that they needed to start documenting their work.  This was the origin of the RFCs.</p>

<p>When a someone wanted to propose the adoption a new protocol, or documentation standard, they would write up their idea in a ‘Request for Comments’ document, which was then circulated to the other people in the team, who would then provide comments and suggest changes.</p>

<p>It was a very collaborative, non-hierachical way of working - everyone’s input was welcome, and decision was reached by consensus.</p>

<p>At some point, they realised that there were no experts, and no one was going to come and take over, so they just carried on designing and implementing the basic protocols and working out how their computers would communicate.</p>

<p>Originally the RFCs would be circulated as typewritten documents via the postal service, but once the network was able to transmit information, they were distributed using the forerunner to email.</p>

<p>These are the titles of the first 25 RFC documents:</p>

<ul class="textlist">
<li>0001 -	Host Software - S. Crocker [ April 1969 ]</li>
<li>0002 -	Host software - B. Duvall [ April 1969 ]</li>
<li>0003 -	Documentation conventions - S.D. Crocker [ April 1969 ]</li> 
<li>0004 -	Network timetable - E.B. Shapiro [ March 1969 ]</li>

<li>0017 -	Some questions re: Host-IMP Protocol - J.E. Kreznar [ August 1969 ]</li> 
<li>0018 -	IMP-IMP and HOST-HOST Control Links - V. Cerf [ September 1969 ]</li>
<li>0019 -	Two protocol suggestions to reduce congestion at swap bound nodes - J.E. Kreznar [ October 1969 ]</li> 
<li>0020 -	ASCII format for network interchange - V.G. Cerf [ October 1969 ]</li>
<li>0021 -	Network meeting - V.G. Cerf [ October 1969 ]</li> 
<li>0022 -	Host-host control message formats - V.G. Cerf [ October 1969 ]</li> 
<li>0023 -	Transmission of Multiple Control Messages - G. Gregg [ October 1969 ] </li>
<li>0024 -	Documentation Conventions - S.D. Crocker [ November 1969 ]</li>
<li>0025 -	No High Link Numbers - S.D. Crocker [ October 1969 ] </li>
</ul>

<p>A full list of the documents can be found <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-index.html">here</a>, and the text of any RFC can be read online.</p>

<p>In the early RFCs you can see the network being designed as it happens.</p>

<p>For example, in RFC 0004 you can find the testing timetable, and the first maps of what eventually became the Internet.</p>

<p>The first connection was between the Stanford Research Institute, and the University of California Los Angeles.</p>

<p>There also grew up a tradition of joke RFCs, issued on April 1st, such as:</p>

<ul class="textlist">
<li>1149 - Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams on avian carriers - D. Waitzman [ 1 April 1990 ]</li>
<li>1438 - Internet Engineering Task Force Statements Of Boredom (SOBs) - A. Lyman Chapin, C. Huitema [ 1 April 1993 ] </li>
<li>1925 - The Twelve Networking Truths - R. Callon [ 1 April 1996 ]</li>
<li>2324 - Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0) - L. Masinter [ 1 April 1998 ]</li>
</ul>

<p>The system is still used to document new protocols, and modifications to old ones, to this very day.</p>

<p>At the time of writing the most recent RFC is RFC 9026, published in April 2021.</p>
